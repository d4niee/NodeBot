## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run following scripts:

### `npm run deploy`

This bot uses the newest feature of discord.js v13 called "slash commands". Because of that we need to register
the files in the ./commands folder as valid commands.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the normal mode.\
this script combines the normal launch and the deploy of commands. 
Changes in the code will have no effect until the client is restarted.

### `npm run dev`

Launches the developer mode.\
In this mode you can change the code and it will be updated without
restarting the application.

### `npm run test`

Runs the App in the Debug mode for developing and finding Bugs/Errors
